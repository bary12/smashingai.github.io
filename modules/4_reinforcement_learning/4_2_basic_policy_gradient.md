# Basic Policy Gradient

{: .key-concepts }
> Policy Gradient, REINFORCE, on-policy vs off-policy

<!--
    Notes:
    * Include the main drawback of on-policy training: can't use old data to update the policy.
    * Include the main drawbacks of REINFORCE e.g. high variance, etc.  
    * Include derivation of the policy gradient loss.
    * Assume discount_rate is 1 and there is a single reward at the end of the run.
